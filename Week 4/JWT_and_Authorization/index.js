/*How JWT Works in Authentication
User logs in â†’ The server verifies credentials.
Server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
Client stores the JWT (e.g., local storage, HTTP-only cookie).
Client sends JWT in requests (e.g., in Authorization header).
Server verifies JWT and processes the request.*/

/*
Role of the Secret Key
When signing a JWT using HMAC (e.g., HS256, HS384, HS512), the secret key is used to create a unique signature.
The same secret key is required to verify the token later.
If someone tries to modify the JWT without the correct secret, verification will fail */
